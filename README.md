# Text Summarizer

Text Summarization Python helps in summarizing and shortening the text. It can be done with the help of an algorithm that can help in reducing the text bodies while keeping their original meaning intact or by giving insights into their original text.

## Two different approaches are used for Text Summarization

• **Extractive Summarization**

In Extractive Summarization, we are identifying important phrases or sentences from the original text and extract only these phrases from the text. These extracted sentences would be the summary.

• **Abstractive Summarization**

In the Abstractive Summarization approach, we work on generating new sentences from the original text. The abstractive method is in contrast to the approach that was described above. The sentences generated through this approach might not even be present in the original text.

We are going to focus on using extractive methods. This method functions by identifying important sentences or excerpts from the text and reproducing them as part of the summary. In this approach, no new text is generated, only the existing text is used in the summarization process. 

## Cosine Similarity

is the cosine of the angle between two n-dimensional vectors in an n-dimensional space. It is the dot product of the two vectors divided by the product of the two vectors' lengths (or magnitudes).
